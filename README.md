 Scripts for games on Steam Deck to adapt resolution to whatever is available

 These are more for advanced users, or for those who know what they are doing or looking for when using these.
 
 Expect to have to alter the scripts to suit your own environment.

 To use them, put `<path/to/script> && %command%` in your game's launch options in Steam.

 This also works for non-Steam games.

 If you are using environment variables as part of your launch options, they must be placed after `&&`

 `<path/to/script> && PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%` for example.
